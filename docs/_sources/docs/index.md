# EarthCube 2022 Notebooks

The NSF EarthCube program was created to advance cyberinfrastructure and
technological practices in support of Geoscience research.  A key aspect of that
has long been a challenge with the sharing, reuse, and reproducibility of
software and tools developed by the community.  Towards this the EarthCube
office (ECO) in conjunction with the Leadership Council (LC) and Technical
Architecture Committee (TAC) piloted the notion of soliciting peer reviewed
notebooks as scholarly objects to be published as part of the EarthCube annual
meeting.   Submitted notebooks would highlight a tool (i.e. software, service,
library, dataset, standard), explaining and demonstrating interactively how the
tool may be used to address a significant problem in geoscience. Submissions are
then peer reviewed in terms of their impact on geoscience research and overall
usability by reviewers from the geoscience and cyberinfrastructure communities.
The accepted notebooks can be found here as part of this JupyterBook serving as
the 2022 EarthCube Annual Meeting proceedings.
