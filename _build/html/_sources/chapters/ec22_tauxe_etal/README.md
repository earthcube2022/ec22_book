### Abstract

The MagIC database (Magnetics Information Consortium) is a database that allows magnetic measurement data of rocks and archaeological artifacts to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. It is housed at https://earthref.org/MagIC. Data can be accessed either through a web browser or through API queries, the most direct of which connects a dataset to the DOI of the publication using Python code that is part of the PmagPy software package (https://github.org/PmagPy/PmagPy). Data can therefore be downloaded, unpacked, re-analyzed or imaged and then repackaged and uploaded back into a private workspace of the user. Jupyter notebooks can then be attached to a new publication and serve as important supplemental material for publication, making the data and the analysis thereof transparent and reproducible. We will illustrate the use of Jupyter notebooks in connection with FAIR data practices in the rock and paleomagnetic world.

### Instructions

Use the "Binder" button at the top of this README to launch the notebook in Binder and execute the cells once the notebook is loaded in JupyterLab.
