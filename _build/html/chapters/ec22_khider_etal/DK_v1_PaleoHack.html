<h2>Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PaleoHack aims to train a new generation of paleogeoscientists to use emerging standards and tools developed through EarthCube, namely the Linked Paleo Data Format (LiPD [1]) and Pyleoclim [2]. Training is accomplished through biannual <a class="reference external" href="https://linked.earth/paleoHackathon">hackathons</a> open to researchers at various career stages. The activities are organized around eight self-guided Jupyter Notebook-based tutorials deployed on a JupyterHub walking the participants through an introduction to Pyleoclim and its object-oriented programming interface to using the package in advanced scientific paleoclimate workflows [3]. These notebooks were based on several studies published within the LinkedEarth group over the past several years.</p>
<p>The notebooks are hosted on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LinkedEarth/paleoHackathon">GitHub</a> and made available through <a class="reference external" href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LinkedEarth/paleoHackathon/HEAD">myBinder</a> for execution, allowing a growing number of scientists to access these training resources without participating in the hackathons. Notebooks 1 and 2 provide general Python and Pyleoclim tutorials while Notebooks 3 to 8 walk through workflows from published studies in the field using Pyleoclim. The notebooks provide example code that can be executed with the data uploaded to the GitHub repository and exercises to test understanding of specific functionalities.</p>
<p>In addition to the Pyleoclim-dedicated notebooks, a basic scientific Python <a class="reference external" href="http://linked.earth/ec_workshops_py/">training website</a> was deployed for new Python users. This website uses material developed by the EarthCube community, in particular <a class="reference external" href="https://projectpythia.org">Project Pythia</a>. Although it is not meant as a replacement for an <em>Introduction to Python</em> course, it provides a basic understanding of data structures and analysis code in Python, which Pyleoclim aims to automate and complement for paleoclimate datasets.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notebook is to walk through two of the notebooks and the pedagogy behind its development. In this particular examples, we will be examining (1) the relationship between insolation and a composite of three <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> records from Chinese speleothems (Sanbao, Hulu, and Dongge caves, [4]) and (2) the danger of relying too strongly on correlation analysis for the interpretation of paleoclimate data using a speleothem record from Crystal Cave, CA ([5]). The version presented here is the <em>instructor copy</em>, which contains the answers to the various exercises and is stored on a private GitHub repository.</p>

<h2>Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#methodology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This notebook utilizes <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Pyleoclim</a>[2], a Python package for the analysis and visualization of paleoclimate data. Pyleoclim builds upon standard Python libraries, namely numpy, pandas, matplotlib, cartopy, and scikit-learn (among others). The package is designed around object-oriented <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/core/ui.html#series-pyleoclim-series">Series</a>, which can be manipulated for plotting, spectral and wavelet analysis, and other time series appropriate operations.</p>
<p>An high-level diagram of Pyleoclim user APIs is shown below.</p>
<img src='https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/_images/Pyleoclim_API.png' width="800">
<p>This notebook features two tutorials based on paleoclimate records obtained from both non-LiPD (csv and a record generated from the <a class="reference external" href="https://climlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">climlab</a> library [6]) and LiPD-formatted datasets to illustrate how Pyleoclim can be used with various data formats. It walks through basic data visualization and analysis of the records using coherence, correlation, and causality. During hackahtons, participants are asked to answer specific questions in the notebooks, designed to help them learn Pyleoclim as well as critically thinking about their scientific objectives. For the purpose of this presentation, the answers will be provided in cells labeled as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">answers</span></code>.</p>

<h2>Tutorial 1: Forcing and response<a class="headerlink" href="#tutorial-1-forcing-and-response" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A common task in paleoclimatology is to relate a record (or several of them) to what is thought to be their forcing. A classic example comes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> records from Chinese speleothems, broadly interpreted as reflecting continental-scale monsoon circulations.

<p><strong>Exercise 1.3</strong> Interpret this plot, leaning on the documentation of <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/core/ui.html#pyleoclim.core.ui.Series.wavelet_coherence"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coherence</span></code></a>. What do arrows pointing to the right mean?</p>
<p><strong>Answer 1.3</strong> In the 20kyr band, the records are in phase (the arrows are pointing right).</p>
<p>We do see fairly incoherent behavior at short time scales. That is to be expected, as the insolation curve is a very smooth, modulated harmonic (or nearly so) coming from theoretical calculations, while the speleothem composite is a real-world dataset with real-world uncertainties. Before spending valuable CPU time to compute significance limits (a non-trivial endeavor), let’s break out some possible tools to clean this up.</p>

<p>The previous notebook in the hackathon series (not reproduced here) introduces SSA, which we now apply to this record. However, this turns out to be quite a long series for SSA, and the decomposition takes an impossibly long while. Since our purpose is to isolate long wavelengths (low frequencies), it’s just as convenient to first coarse-grain the series prior to analysis.

<p><strong>Exercise 1.8</strong> Recompute wavelet coherence with the coarse-grained, filtered isotopic record. What changes? Was it worth it? How would you summarize the relationship between insolation and the Sanbao/Hulu/Dongge composite?</p>

<p><strong>Answer 1.8</strong>: Cleaned up effectively for frequencies down to 1/10kyr (to be expected from the filter). Record seems to be in-phase with insolation over the orbital band.</p>

<h2>Tutorial 2: Fishing for Correlations at Sea<a class="headerlink" href="#tutorial-2-fishing-for-correlations-at-sea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Correlation analysis, despite its simplicity and many shortcomings, remains a centerpiece of empirical analysis in many fields, particularly the paleosciences. Computing correlations is trivial enough; the difficulty lies in properly assessing their significance. Of particular importance are four considerations:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Persistence</strong>, which violates the standard assumption that the data are independent (which underlies the classical test of significance implemented, e.g. in Excel).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time irregularities</strong>, for instance comparing two records with different time axes, possibly unevenly spaced (which standard software cannot deal with out of the box)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Age uncertainties</strong>, for example comparing two records, each with an ensemble of plausible chronologies (generated, for instance, by a Bayesian age model)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Test multiplicity</strong> aka the “Look Elsewhere effect”, which states that repeatedly performing the same test can result in unacceptably high type I error (accepting correlations as significant, when in fact they are not). This arises e.g. when correlating a paleoclimate record with an instrumental field, assessing significance at thousands of grid points at once, or assessing significance within an age ensemble.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, Pyleoclim facilitates an assessment of correlations that deals with all these cases, makes the necessary data transformations transparent to the user, and allows for one-line plot commands to visualize the results.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-case-study-from-crystal-cave">
<h3>A case study from Crystal Cave<a class="headerlink" href="#a-case-study-from-crystal-cave" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this notebook we reproduce the case of [9], particularly the example of their section 4, which illustrates several of these pitfalls at once. The example illuminates the issue of relying too strongly on correlations between a paleoclimate record and an instrumental field to interpret the record. Before we start, a disclaimer: the studies investigated in this paper are by no means isolated cases. They just happened to be cases that we knew about, and thought deserved a second look in light of more rigorous statistics. The same study could have been written by subsituting any number of other records interpreted, wholly or in part, on the basis of correlations. Accordingly, what follows should not be viewed as an indictment of a particularly study or group of authors, rather, at how easy it is by the best-intentioned scientists to get fooled by spurious correlations, and (thankfully), how easy we’ve made it not get similarly fooled by carrying out this analysis with pyleoclim.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-crystal-cave-record">
<h4>The Crystal Cave record<a class="headerlink" href="#the-crystal-cave-record" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The example uses the speleothem record of [6] from Crystal Cave, California, in the Sequoia National Forest. Of interest to us is the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span> record, which the authors interepret as reflecting sea-surface temperatures (SST) in the Kuroshio Extension region of the West Pacific. This is a strong claim, given that no mechanistic link is proposed, and relies entirely on an analysis of correlations between the record and instrumental SST.</p>
<p>We first load and plot this record. Since this record is available in LiPD format, we can use methods specific to this file format, which rely on the greater availability of metadata.</p>

<h3>Pitfall #1: Persistence<a class="headerlink" href="#pitfall-1-persistence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Persistence is the tendency of many geophysical timeseries (particularly paleoclimate ones) to show some kind of memory: consecutive observations tend to resemble each other, resulting in timeseries that have fairly broad trends and low-frequency fluctuations, and comparatively little high-frequency fluctuations.</p>
<p>This has an important consequence: the standard assumption of independence, which undergirds much of frequentist statistics, is violated in this case. In a timeseries with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> fully independent observations (e.g. white noise), the degrees of freedom for the variance are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(DOF = n -1\)</span>  But if memory is present, this number can be drastically reduced.</p>

<p>Notice the coverage gaps in the 1860s. This, and the fact that the Crystal Cave chronology is not uniformly spaced, would ordinarily make it challenging to compare the two series, requiring some form of interpolation or binning. Pyleoclim does all this for you under the hood.</p>
<p>To enjoy these benefits, however, let us turn the temperature data into a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Series</span></code> object.</p>

<p>Quite a few things happened here. First, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyleoclim</span></code> was smart enough to figure out a common timespan between the two records, and used linear interpolation to align the two timeseries on a common axis. It did all this under the hood without you having to lift a finger, but you could get your head in there and customize this process (e.g. choosing a different way to align the time axes) if you wanted it too.</p>
<p>Now, about the result: the correlation is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=0.32\)</span>. Is it significant?</p>
<p>The standard way to assess this uses a t-test using the test statistic: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T = \frac{r \sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(.

<p>In other words, using the classic test for the significance of correlations “out of the box”, one would conclude that SST at 42N, 164E shares so much similarity with the Crystal Cave record that there are only 3 chances in 10,000 that this could have happened randomly. In other words, it looks <em>very</em> significant.</p>
<p>But let’s take a step back. That test (which is the one that most computing packages, including Excel, will do for you out of the box), is not appropriate here. Why? Because the assumption of independence tramples over the concept of persistence with gleeful impunity. That is, it assumes that consecutive observations bear no resemblance to each other, which is true neither of the Crystal Cave nor the instrumental target. That is to say: because temperature in one year tends to resemble temperature in the previous or following year (same for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta^{18}O\)</span>), the data are anything but independent. We will quantify this dependence, and its consequences, in a minute.</p>
<p>Going back to the result of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">correlation()</span></code> command, let’s look at its full output:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice that the p-value has been estimated to be 12% (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'p':</span> <span class="pre">0.12</span></code>), and therefore the correlation is not deemed significant (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'signif':</span> <span class="pre">False</span></code>) at the 5% level (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'alpha':</span> <span class="pre">0.05</span></code>).</p>
<p>How did <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyleoclim</span></code> arrive at such a different conclusion? By not applying irrelevant assumptions, of course! To know what method was applied exactly precisely, consult the <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/utils/correlation/corr_sig.html#pyleoclim.utils.correlation.corr_sig">documentation</a> or the function’s docstring.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.1</strong> What method does <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">correlation</span></code> use by default to assess significance and what are its assumptions? (hint: check out “correlation” on <a class="reference external" href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Read The Docs</a>, under “The Pyleoclim user interface”), or type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stts.correlation?</span></code> at the prompt.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2.1</strong> The default method is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'isospectral</span></code>, which phase-randomizes the original signals, thereby preserving the two spectra but scrambling phase relations between the signals. This is the method proposed by Ebisuzaki (1997).</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.2</strong> There are in fact 3 ways to make this determination in Pyleoclim. Try the other two in the cells below, and compare their p-values on 2-3 trials. Do they give consistent answers or not?  (Hint: use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">settings</span></code> dictionary to pass a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">method</span></code> parameters, and explore the effect of the parameter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nsim</span></code>)</p>

<p><strong>Answer 1.2</strong> The other two methods are the T-test adjusted for the loss of degrees of freedom due to persistence, and the isopersistent test, which compares the observed correlation to the distribution of correlations with (by default) 1000 randomly-generated AR(1) timeseries with the same persistence parameters as the original series. In this particular case, the T-test also judges the correlation to be insignificant, but the isopersistent test is more finicky: sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nsim</span></code> only affects the methods that use Monte Carlo simulations (isopersistent and isospectral).  Upping <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nsim</span></code> ensures more consistent results: for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nsim</span> <span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">2000</span></code>, the result is consistently judged insignificant.</p>
<p>In this case, the three methods concur that the correlation is insignificant, given a sufficient number of simulations.</p>

<p>The foregoing shows how to properly assess significance at just one location. How would we go about conducting a similar test for an entire field? Let us first try the naive approach: recursively carry out the same test as above at all grid points.  For this, we need not only to loop over grid points, but also store the p-values for later analysis. To save time, we’ll use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ttest</span></code> option for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">correlation()</span></code>, knowing that it is rather approximate.

<p>The purple dots on the map are the locations of the gridpoints where the p-values fall under 5%, and they naturally correspond to the regions of highest correlations, though (and this is suspicious) they are rather randomly scattered across the domain.<br />
We might be tempted to declare victory and hail them as “significant”, but not so fast!
Our correlation test, nifty though it is, isn’t infallible. In fact, conducting tests at the 5% level (what most people would call “the 95% confidence level”) specifically means that we expect 5% of our tests to return spurious results, just from chance alone (the so-called “type I error”). We just carried out <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_t\)</span> tests, so we expect <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.05*n_t \approx 16 \)</span> of those results to be false positives, right out of the gate.  Which ones can we trust?</p>
<p>One way to approach this is to rank order the p-values of all 327 tests and plot them as in [9], Fig 2.</p>

<p>One solution to this is the False Discovery Rate (aka <strong>FDR</strong>), which was devised in a celebrated 1995 paper <a class="reference external" href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x">10</a>. The idea is to look not just for the p-values under 5% (red dots in the figure above), but for the fraction of those under the blue line, which guards against the false discoveries one expects out of repeatedly testing the same hypothesis over and over again. Luckily for you, we have this coded up in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyleoclim</span></code> (you knew we would). One way to access it is thus:</p>

<p>And with this treatment, exactly 0 gridpoints pass the test.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.3</strong> redo this with other correlation methods and see if the results change. A little patience is required for the other two methods, which loop over surrogates. We suggest using a moderate number of simulations (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nsim</span></code> &lt; 500) to do so; please check the documentation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">corr_sig</span></code> for how to reduce this number, which is 1000 by default.</p>

<h3>Pitfall #3: Age uncertainties<a class="headerlink" href="#pitfall-3-age-uncertainties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As if the first two pitfalls weren’t enough, there is a third difficulty in this comparison: beautiful though U/Th chronologies may be, they are not perfect (do not believe people who tell you otherwise!). Such chronological uncertainties must be taken into account as well.</p>
<p>It turns out that the LiPD file loaded above contains not only the raw U/Th dates (dig for them if you’re curious), but also an ensemble of age-depth relationships derived from those dates, via the Bayesian age model <a class="reference external" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Bchron/vignettes/Bchron.html">BChron</a>. Let us load those 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of ages and put them in a place where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyleoclim</span></code> will be able to work with them:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There are two ways to plot this ensemble. First, as a series of traces:</p>

</div>
<p>It is quite plain that any of the record’s main swings can be swung back and forth by up to decades. Another way to see this is to plot various quantiles as an envelope:</p>

<p>Notice how the quantiles are computed over only part of the interval covered by the original series; that is because some age models end up being more compressed or stretched out than the original, and we need a common interval to compute quantiles. In particular, notice how the base of the record could really be anywhere between 850 and 1100 AD.
Now, what we’d like to do is repeat the exercise of Part 1, correlating the same SST timeseries from 32.5N 142.5W (near the Kuroshio Extension), not just with the published chronology, but this whole ensemble. Remember how we had computed things:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Though of course, we could have done just the reverse, as correlation is a symmetric operator:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">corr_res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">correlation</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stts</span><span class="p">)</span>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, consider the task ahead: you must iterate over all ensemble members, taking care of aligning their time axis to that of HadSST4; you must compute the correlation and establish its significance with a sensible test (say, Ebisuzaki’s isospectral test, see Pitfall #1), you need watch out for test multiplicity (see Pitfall #2) <em>and</em>  you need to visualize the results in an intuitive way. Needless to say, Pyleoclim has the answer.</p>
<p>To keep computing time manageable, let’s reduce the number of isospectral simulations to 500, and correlate the ensemble and the SST series:</p>

<p>Several things jump out at once:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>the correlation histogram is relatively symmetric, meaning that age uncertainties are able to completely overturn the original correlation of about 0.31 : nearly half of the ensemble exhibits negative correlations with SST).  0.31 (9% of common variance) is not a contender for winning the correlation olympics, but it was at least positive. Age uncertainties can easily reverse even the <em>sign</em> of the correlation, not to mention alter its magnitude.</p></li>
<li><p>As shown in teal, only a few % of the 500*100 correlations just computed are judged significant (note: this would change somewhat every time you run the calculation, based on the randomness of the phase randomization procedure. If reproducibility is essential, you  may also input a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed">random seed</a> to ensure that the same exact random sequence is used from iteration to iteration.</p></li>
<li><p>Once we take test multiplicity into account via the False Discovery Rate (orange bar), only a fraction of a %  is deemed significant.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.4</strong> redo this at other locations and see if the results change. you may consider picking a patch of the North Pacific and applying this test recursively at each location.</p>

<h3>Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.5</strong>  To bring it all together, summarize everything that can go wrong when fishing for correlations (at sea, or on land). Can you think of other papers where correlations with paleoclimate records might have been used unwisely? (no names needed… Just keep that in mind in your own work and point people to more defensible ways of dealing with this danger, i.e. Pyleoclim!)</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2.5</strong> The moral of the story is that all of these pitfalls matter ; any single one of them can turn a correlation initially reported as “significant” into insignificant ones. That is especially the case with a conjunction of pitfalls, with any 2 out of 3. The conjunction of all 3 pitfalls (persistence, test multiplicity, and age uncertainties) is particularly damaging in this example. Fortunatly, Pyleoclim makes it easy to deal with those pitfalls, so there is no excuse not to.</p>
